Eclipse Kura - 5.6.0 - November 2024
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
This minor release of Eclipse Kura, compatible with Java 8 and OSGi R7, introduces features and changes to simplify the user interaction and deployment of the framework.
This release contains improvements and simplifications to the cellular configuration, leveraging NetworkManager, allowing to enable a cellular interface without the need to specify a modem dial string or APN.
A change has been made to the profiles to give more flexibility and connectivity ease of use when installed on gateways with more than one ethernet interfaces.
A new scale and offset modality has been added to the asset component.
A new provider that allows to retrieve location information from ModemManager has been added to the PositionService. 
The release contains a number of bug fixes and general feature improvements.

Known Issues:
  * During a wifi scan, some access points with the WPA/WPA2 wifi security are recognized as WPA.
  * On devices with Ubuntu 20.04, the DHCP server provided by isc-dhcp-server may not assign an IP address to the clients. Use dnsmasq instead.
  * Snapshot rollback operation may fail processing factory component configurations.
  * The firewall rule applied by the network threat manager that block uncommon TCP MSS values is not applied in the Nvidia Jetson Nano.
  * When the IPv6 network threat manager is disabled, the filtering on TCP fragments is disabled only after a reboot.
  * The republish.mqtt.birth.cert.on.modem.detect property in the CloudService configuration is not supported for devices that use NetworkManager. The property value is ignored.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, only one file is used to store the leases.
  * When dnsmasq is used as DHCP server, the DHCP List field in the DHCP and NAT tab shows the leases for all the interfaces.
  * The system reboot command cannot be issued even with a privileged user in Debian Bookworm due to an OS issue related to the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability.
  * The Wi-Fi AP scanning may fail in Debian Bookworm on the first scanning attempt in the specific Raspberry PI profile. A forced rescan can succeed and properly display the available APs.
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano installer disables FAN protocol support due to compatibility issues (see #4593)
  * The nvidia-jetson-nano doesn't support the Unprivileged Command Service (see #3598)
  * isc-dhcp-server fails upon first Kura installation on Raspberry Pi Bullseye. This is due to how the isc-dhcp-server installer package is
    built and run immediately after installation.
  * An update to the sslmanagerservice where the pid of the keystoreservice is updated can lead to an error in the following reconnection.
    The issue impact is limited, if the dataservice reconnect option is enabled.
  * The implementation of the CryptoService performs encryption using a
    password that is hardcoded and published.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2 has only been tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported with old networking. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
